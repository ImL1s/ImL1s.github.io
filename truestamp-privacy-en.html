    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="date">Last Updated: December 26, 2025</div>

    <p><strong>TrueStamp Timestamp Camera</strong> (hereinafter referred to as "the App") is developed and operated by
        <strong>ImL1s</strong> (hereinafter referred to as "we" or "us"). We highly value your privacy, and this Privacy
        Policy aims to explain how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.</p>

    <h2>1. About the App</h2>
    <p>This App is a professional timestamp camera application that automatically adds time, location, GPS coordinates,
        weather, and other information as watermarks when taking photos. It is suitable for construction site
        documentation, insurance claims evidence, news reporting, and other scenarios requiring proof of time.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>To provide complete functionality and services, this App may collect or use the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Data</strong>: If you choose to use Google Sign-In or Apple Sign-In, we will obtain your
            basic account information (such as email address and display name) through Firebase Authentication to
            provide account synchronization and cloud backup features.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data</strong>: This App requires access to your location to display address and GPS
            coordinates in photo watermarks. Location information is only read when taking photos and is not
            continuously tracked.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera & Photos</strong>: This App requires access to the camera for taking photos and access to the
            photo library to save or read photos. Photo data is only stored locally on your device or in cloud storage
            of your choice.</li>
        <li><strong>Weather Data</strong>: If you enable the weather watermark feature, the App will send queries to
            third-party weather APIs based on your location to retrieve current weather information.</li>
        <li><strong>Team & Project Data</strong>: If you use the team feature, your team information, project data, and
            related photos will be stored in Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage to provide team collaboration and
            data synchronization features.</li>
        <li><strong>Device & Log Data</strong>: When the App encounters errors or crashes, we may collect crash-related
            log data (via Google Firebase Crashlytics), including device model, operating system version, and time of
            error occurrence, to help fix issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: We use Google Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage data (such as page
            views and feature usage frequency) to analyze user behavior and optimize the App experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This App integrates or uses the following third-party services, which may collect and process your data according
        to their privacy policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Analytics, Crashlytics)</strong>: For account
            verification, data storage, photo storage, data analysis, and error reporting.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Maps / Geocoding API</strong>: For obtaining address information and map functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Weather API</strong>: For obtaining weather information.</li>
        <li><strong>NTP Time Server</strong>: For calibrating accurate time.</li>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong>: For displaying advertisements. AdMob may use device identifiers and other
            information to provide personalized ads.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong>: For managing in-app subscription services.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong>: For Google Sign-In and app updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Sign in with Apple</strong>: For Apple Sign-In functionality (iOS platform only).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Digital Signature and Anti-Tampering</h2>
    <p>This App provides digital signature functionality to add anti-tampering signatures to your photos. Signature keys
        are stored locally on your device (using secure storage mechanisms) and are not uploaded to our servers.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We are committed to protecting your information security and take reasonable technical measures to prevent
        unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure. Your data is encrypted during transmission and storage through
        Firebase's security mechanisms. However, please note that Internet transmission cannot be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Deletion</h2>

        will be permanently removed. If you need assistance deleting data, please contact us using the contact
