    <h1>Privacy Policy for WearWallet</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: December 31, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>WearWallet ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile and Wear OS applications.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1 Personal Data</h3>
    <p>WearWallet is a self-custodial wallet. We <strong>do not</strong> collect any personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, email address, or phone number.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Blockchain Data</h3>
    <p>All transaction data is stored on public blockchains. We do not store your private keys, seed phrases, or passwords on any servers. These are stored locally on your device using industry-standard encryption.</p>

    <h2>2. Information Usage</h2>
    <p>We use the information you provide locally to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Facilitate blockchain transactions and interactions.</li>
        <li>Display account balances and history.</li>
        <li>Provide real-time market data through third-party APIs (e.g., Infura, Moralis, CoinGecko).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>WearWallet interacts with certain third-party services to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blockchain Nodes (e.g., Infura):</strong> To broadcast transactions and fetch data.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> For analytics and crash reporting to improve app stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware Wallets (e.g., Keystone):</strong> Via QR code scanning for air-gapped signing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services may collect data according to their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement enterprise-grade security measures to protect your local data including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Android Keystore:</strong> For secure key storage.</li>
        <li><strong>AES-256-GCM Encryption:</strong> For sensitive data.</li>
        <li><strong>Biometric Authentication:</strong> For app access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>As a self-custodial wallet user, you have full control over your data. You can delete your wallet from the device at any time, which will remove all local data associated with it.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
