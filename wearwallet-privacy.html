    <h1>WearWallet Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        WearWallet is a multichain cryptocurrency wallet designed for Wear OS and watchOS smartwatches.
        We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your digital assets.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>WearWallet is designed with privacy as a core principle. We collect minimal data necessary for the app to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wallet Data:</strong> All wallet information (private keys, addresses, transaction history) is stored locally on your device and encrypted using industry-standard encryption (AES-256-GCM).</li>
        <li><strong>Camera Permission:</strong> We request camera access solely for scanning QR codes to facilitate:
            <ul>
                <li>Transaction signing with Keystone 3 Pro hardware wallet (air-gapped communication)</li>
                <li>Importing wallet addresses</li>
                <li>Receiving cryptocurrency payments</li>
            </ul>
            Camera data is processed locally and never uploaded to any server.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Network Access:</strong> Required to connect to blockchain networks (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.) for checking balances and broadcasting transactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All sensitive data (private keys, seed phrases) is encrypted and stored locally on your device using Android Keystore and iOS Keychain.</li>
        <li>We do NOT store your private keys, passwords, or seed phrases on any remote server.</li>
        <li>Transaction data is retrieved directly from public blockchain networks.</li>
        <li>Optional 1Password integration is available for secure credential management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>WearWallet may use the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blockchain RPC Providers:</strong> Infura, Alchemy, or other RPC services to connect to blockchain networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> For crash reporting and analytics (anonymized). You can opt-out in app settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Price Data Providers:</strong> CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap for real-time cryptocurrency prices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services have their own privacy policies. We do not share your personal wallet information with these services.</p>

    <h2>5. Keystone Hardware Wallet Integration</h2>
    <p>
        When using Keystone 3 Pro hardware wallet features:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>QR code communication is air-gapped and processed locally</li>
        <li>Private keys never leave the Keystone device</li>
        <li>Transaction data is transmitted via animated QR codes using bc-ur protocol</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. User Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access all data stored by the app (wallet data is fully accessible in the app)</li>
        <li>Delete your wallet data at any time (uninstalling the app removes all local data)</li>
        <li>Opt-out of analytics and crash reporting</li>
        <li>Export your wallet using standard seed phrase or private key formats</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        WearWallet is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect
        personal information from children.

        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of significant changes
        through app updates or notifications. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance
        of the updated policy.
